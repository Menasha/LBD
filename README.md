Time-sliced Evaluation: In a time-slicing setting, the LBD system uses _known knowledge_ to make its predictions and verifies whether the proposed novel knowledge linkages have actually taken place in the _future_. The proposed novel linkage is _legitimate_ if it is _absent_ in the _known knowledge_ and _present_ in _future knowledge_.
